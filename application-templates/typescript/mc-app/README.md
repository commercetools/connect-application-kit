To create Custom Application for the Merchant Center you can visit [getting starter documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/getting-started).

The easiest way to get started is to use Merchant Center's [starter template](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/getting-started#installing-a-starter-template). The app should live inside this folder and it should be the Custom Application's root folder.
