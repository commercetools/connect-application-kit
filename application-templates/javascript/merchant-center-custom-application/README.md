To create Custom Application for the Merchant Center you can visit [getting starter documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/getting-started).

The easiest way to get started is to use Merchant Center's [starter template](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/getting-started#installing-a-starter-template). The app should live inside this folder and it should be the Custom Application's root folder.

Once you finished developing the Merchant Center application, review and uncomment the proper configuration in [connect.yaml](../connect.yaml) to enable this application as part of the connector.
