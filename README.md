  <i>âœ¨ Monorepository with tools and components for developing connect applications ðŸ› </i>
</p>

> Connect starter kit and tools are marked as beta and subject to change. Use with caution.



## Template Features
- **Typescript & Javascript**: languages supported
- **Express**: Web server framework
- **commercetools sdk**: Embedded sdk library for commercetools specific implementation
- **Buildpack support**: Tooling to build production-ready container images from source code without a Dockerfile
- **Local development utilities**: Basic yarn tools to build, start , test, lint & prettify code
- **Structured logging library**: JSON formatted logger with log levels 
- **Tests**: Basic tests setup for application

## Getting started

If you are developing a connect application, you can start by installing one of our [templates](./application-templates) using the `create-connect-app` CLI.

```bash
$ npm install --global @commercetools-connect/create-connect-app
$ create-connect-app first-connect-application --template [typescript | javascript]

# or

$ npx @commercetools-connect/create-connect-app@latest first-connect-application --template [typescript | javascript]
```

# Developing connect applications

Before starting the development, we advise the developers to create a `.env` file in order to help them in local development.

For that, we also have a template file `.env.example` with the required environement variables for the project to run successfuly. To make it work, rename the file from `.env.example` to `.env`. Remember to fill the variables with your values.

### Install the dependencies (uses yarn workspaces):

```bash
$ yarn
```

### To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test

# or
$ yarn test:watch
```

### Build the application

```bash
$ yarn build

# or
$ yarn build:watch
```

### Run the application locally

```bash
$ yarn start

# or
$ yarn start:dev
```

# Connect Certification

In order to deploy your connect application on commercetools provided infrastructure, it needs to reviewed by certification team. This can be requested by creating a listing using <a href="https://docs.commercetools.com">connect APIs </a> <em>(not yet released)</em>

A default starter pack has a directory structure as shown below, repository should be a mono repo setup where you can choose to have more than one application in a single connector if needed

```
â”œâ”€â”€ <docs>
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ readme.md
â”œâ”€â”€ <app1>
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ <app2>
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ connect.yaml

```

You can choose to remove/add applications based on needs with similar repository structure.

Connect deployment details needs to be specified in `connect.yaml` which is required information needed for certificaiton of the application

Buildpack is used to build artifacts to deploy , use `npm start` or `Procfile` to define the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks#default-entrypoint-behavior">default entry point</a>

# Deployment config

Connect supports 3 types of application which needs to set as `applicationType` in the config file
1. `service` - Standalone application which can do a specific task triggered by any HTTP method (can be used for <a href="https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/api-extensions">API extensions</a> or as a webhook to other systems). HTTP url will be generated and exposed as result of the deployment.
2. `event` - Event topics & related consumer services to be able to receive events and perform any task asynchronously (can be used for <a href="https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/subscriptions">Subscriptions</a>). A topic will be generated and exposed as result of the deployment
3. `job` - Task which needs to be performed at regular basis with defined intervals, these tasks can be scheduled using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> expression


A sample deployment config looks like this, refer below for more detailed information on each property

```yaml
deployAs:
  - name: app1
    applicationType: service
    endpoint: /app1
    scripts:
      postDeploy: npm install && npm run build && npm run connector:post-deploy
      preUndeploy: npm install && npm run build && npm run connector:pre-undeploy
    configuration:
      standardConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1
          description: description variable 1
      securedConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_2
          description: description variable 2
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_3
          description: description variable 3
  - name: app2
    applicationType: job
    endpoint: /app2
    properties:
      schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    configuration:
      standardConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1
          description: description variable 1
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_2
          description: description variable 2
  - name: app3
    applicationType: event
    endpoint: /app3
    configuration:
      securedConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1
          description: description variable 1
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_2
          description: description variable 2
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_3
          description: description variable 3
  - name: app4
    applicationType: merchant-center-custom-application
    endpoint: /app4
    configuration:
      standardConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1
          description: description variable 1
      securedConfiguration:
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_2
          description: description variable 2
        - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_3
          description: description variable 3
```

- Multiple applications of same type can be setup
- A schedule property is additional mandatory information needed to be able to schedule the job
- Event type of application needs to be defined together with a service type of application with mandatory subscriber information to process the received event

## Property definition
- `name` - Folder name of respective application component from the root of monorepo which will be used as identifier of the application. Deployment output url, topic & schedule can be fetched based on this reference
- `applicationType` - Type of deployment . Can be one of `service`, `event`, `job` and `merchant-center-custom-application`
- `endpoint` - Point of entry for respective application component
- `scripts.postDeploy` - Post-deploy script to execute after the connector deployment process
- `scripts.preUndeploy` - Pre-undeploy script to execute before the connector undeployment process
- `configuration` - Definiton of all environment variables needed by the application, customer will be responsible to provide value for these variables when choosen to deploy. You need to choose between `standardConfiguration` and `securedConfiguration`. `standardConfiguration` for customer provided values to be saved as plain text , `securedConfiguration` for customer provided values to be secured and stored in encrypted format. configurations can be marked `required` depending on application implementation and also provided a `default` value if needed
- `schedule` - Schedule expression for job applications, it need to be input of type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> expression
